   * The VCS Checkout mode is a setting that affects how project sources reach
   * an agent. This mode affects only sources checkout. The current revision
   * and changes data retrieving logic is executed by the TeamCity server,
   * and thus TeamCity server needs to access the VCS server in any mode.
   *
   * - **MANUAL**: TeamCity will not check out any sources automatically,
   *   the default build checkout directory will still be created so that
   *   you could use it to check out the sources via a build script.
   *
   *   Note that TeamCity will accurately report changes only if the checkout
   *   is performed on the revision specified by the `build.vcs.number.*`
   *   properties passed into the build.
   *
   *   The build checkout directory will not be cleaned automatically,
   *   unless the directory expiration period is configured.
   *
   * - **ON_SERVER**: The TeamCity server will export the sources and pass
   *   them to an agent before each build.
   *
   *   Since the sources are exported rather than checked out, no administrative
   *   data is stored in the agent's file system and version control operations
   *   (like check-in, label or update) cannot be performed from the agent.
   *
   *   TeamCity optimizes communications with the VCS servers by caching the
   *   sources and retrieving from the VCS server only the necessary changes.
   *
   *   Unless clean checkout is performed, the server sends to the agent
   *   incremental patches to update only the files changed since the last
   *   build on the agent in the given checkout directory.
   *
   * - **ON_AGENT**: The build agent will check out the sources before the build.
   *
   *   Agent-side checkout frees more server resources and provides the ability
   *   to access version-control-specific directories (.svn, CVS, .git ); that is,
   *   the build script can perform VCS operations (for example, check-ins into
   *   the version control) â€” in this case ensure the build script uses
   *   credentials necessary for the check-in.
   *
   *   VCS client software has to be installed on the agent
   *   (applicable to Perforce, Mercurial, Git).
   *
   * - **PREFER_ON_AGENT**: With this setting enabled, TeamCity will use the
   *   agent-side checkout (see `ON_AGENT`) if possible.
   *
   *   If the agent-side checkout is not possible, TeamCity will display a
   *   corresponding health report item and will use the server-side checkout
   *   (see the `ON_SERVER`).
   *
   *   TeamCity falls back to the server-side checkout in the following cases:
   *   - No Git or Mercurial client is found on the agent
   *   - The Git or Mercurial client is present on the agent, but is of the wrong version
   *   - The agent has no access to the repository
   *   - If a Perforce client cannot be found on the agent using the same rules
